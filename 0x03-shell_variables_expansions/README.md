  ðŸ¤” **What I Built**

This project dives deep into the essential concepts of shell scripting, focusing on variables, aliases, and expansions. Each script demonstrates practical applications of bash programming fundamentals. Using a variety of exercises, I was able to understand how the shell really works under the hood, and it is quite mindblowing!!
